# About
A long-term personal project for practicing end to end web development.

Essentially, it's just a blog. But it will also be *an online magazine of inspiration with profiles of independent creators, shopowners, and more* - to come! Once I work out the bugs :sweat_smile:


## Built with

- Flask (Python)
- Postgres database (with SQLAlchemy)
- Cloudinary for asset management
